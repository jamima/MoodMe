## Motivation
This project was intended as a refresher into Azure development and an opportunity for further learning into dashboard design and mobile app development to remind me every day that I have made something tangible with my software skills.


## Key Features

* Record your current mood (mood logging)
  - The system keeps track of your mood history, allowing you to enter free-form text to describe your feelings like a diary entry
* View mood history
  - A dashboard allows you to view your mood entries over time, visualized as charts
* Save and view reminders, affirmations and quotes
  - The system displayes these saved affirmations on the dashboard and during mood entry to reflect thinking and ideas you found useful before
